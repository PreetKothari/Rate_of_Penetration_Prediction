# Rate of_Penetration_Prediction

Objective is to build a prediction model for rate of penetration (ROP) during oil & gas drilling operations.

Drilling is an activity for a drilling a hole (you can assume vertical) in the earth’s crust. We can think of this like a hole is drilled in the surface of earth to get drinking water through a hand pump in villages. Objective is to correctly predict Rate of Penetration for provided drilling attributes.

### What is drilling?
Oil drilling is the process by which tubing is bored through the Earth's surface and a well is established. A pump is connected to the tube and the petroleum under the surface is forcibly removed from underground.

### What is a log?
A well log is a record of the formations and any events that are encountered in the well drilling process.

### Why ROP Prediction?
Drilling wells in challenging operating environments implies large capital expenditure. To optimize drilling operations, real-time decisions are critical. Increasing the ROP may result in direct savings for the operator, thus the prediction of rate of penetration (ROP) with accuracy is essential.

Despite many efforts (theoretical and experimental) throughout the years, modelling the ROP as a mathematical function of some key variables is not so trivial, due to the highly non-linearity behaviour experienced. Therefore, several researches in the recent years have been proposing to use data-driven models from artificial intelligence field for ROP prediction and optimization.

Our aim is to encourage participants from both domain and non-domain to come together and find innovative solutions to address the challenge.

### Datasets Description
The dataset is derived from Equinor’s public Volve dataset under Equinor Open Data Licence. The dataset contains seven wells with twelve common drilling attributes with nearly
200,000 samples.
